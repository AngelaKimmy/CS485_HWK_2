Introduction:
My first person game was loosely inspired by Minecraft. It is a survival game where the player tries to destroy enemies with traps before the enemies can destroy the player. 

Gameplay Instructions:
The objective of this game is to destroy the enemies chasing the player before the player can be destroyed by the enemies. The player starts off with full health and can be hit 10 times before the game is over. The player is also given 10 red “TNT” blocks that he can set down with a mouse click. The TNT blocks will destroy enemies on contact, but are limited. There are a total of 10 “Creeper” enemies to destroy. The player wins once all the enemies are destroyed.

My Contributions:
Background music
“Trap” cubes that destroy enemies
Created forest environment
Added a win screen and game over screen where you can replay or return to menu
Created transparent walls around field so nothing would fall out
Made enemies that inflicted damage on the player

Future Improvements:
If given more time, I would like to properly implement my original idea to use an arrow as a projectile. I would also add more enemies and have them drop collectable loot when destroyed. I would also like to expand my game’s map and add more obstacles. This project taught me a lot, and I am interested in expanding it on my own time.
